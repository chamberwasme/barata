<p>The immediacy for me is down to some of the strongest melodies that Haken have ever penned. Best of all Vector proves once again that Hakens remarkable prolificacynow five albums within eight yearsdoesnt really hinder their remarkable formula. Immerhin bleiben HAKEN ein Garant für zeitgemäßen Prog Metal und müssen sich daher vor der Konkurrenz ganz besonders der aus Australien nicht die Blöße geben. Hakens fifth studio album Vector was undoubtedly one of the most anticipated albums of the yearIts not an overstatement to say that Haken has become one of the most important bands in the progressive metal genre with the success of their albums The Mountain 2014 and Affinity 2016I saw them twice in 2017 and I remember thinking to myself that I hadnt seen a progressive metal. Nicht ganz auf dem Level seiner Vorgänger unterhält Vector dennoch über weite Strecken kompetent. Dass Vector ein paar Dellen aufweist ist aber verkraftbar.</p>

<p>Vector pakt steviger en directer uit dan zijn voorganger terwijl er zowel tekstueel als instrumentaal voldoende gelaagdheid is om meerdere luisterbeurten aan de boxen gekluisterd te blijven. In general despite the heaviness of the instrumentation Vector has a weirdly elusive melodic quality and this is only partly because of Jennings vocals. The band itself has gone through a few fases in fact.

<p>Somehow Haken have given vent to their math-metal proclivities but nonetheless produced something that will actually have you humming along at least in parts. In this day and age The Mountain had the potential to foreshadow future stagnation. Vector is a solid package of prog awesomeness. Vector s flow combined with a vinyl appropriate runtime make for an instantly accessible and enjoyable listening experience and I loved it immediately.

<p>The immediacy for me is down to some of the strongest melodies that Haken have ever penned. Vector is the fifth studio from Londons progressive metal stalwarts Haken a band who have been fairly prolific since emerging on the scene in 2010 with their brilliant debut AquariusThis album comes on the heels of the majority of the band taking part in Mike Portnoys Shattered Fortress tour where the guys helped Portnoy relive some of this Dream Theater past for a.
